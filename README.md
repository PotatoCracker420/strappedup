Today, I focused on refining and debugging the website. Here are the key tasks I completed:

- **Fixed Navigation Issues**: Updated relative paths in the navigation menu to ensure proper linking between pages.
- **Added Contact Form**: Integrated a dynamic contact form that loads via JavaScript (`contact.js`) and fetches content from `contact-form.html`.
- **Debugged JavaScript**: Resolved issues with the `contact.js` script to ensure the form loads correctly and handles validation properly.
- **Reviewed Folder Structure**: Verified that the folder structure aligns with file references in the code.
- **Improved Styling**: Ensured the `styles.css` file is applied consistently across all pages.
- **Tested Functionality**: Conducted thorough testing to ensure all links, forms, and dynamic content work as expected.

Looking forward to adding more features and polishing the design further in the coming days!

Today, I made significant progress on the project. Here are the key updates and fixes:

### Enhanced Contact Form
- Ensured the contact form dynamically loads into the `#contact-container` using JavaScript.
- Added validation for required fields (`name`, `email`, and `message`) to improve user experience.
- Displayed success and error messages dynamically based on form submission status.

### Folder Structure Adjustments
- Verified and corrected file paths to ensure all resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) are properly linked.
- Ensured the `contact-form.html` file is correctly fetched by `contact.js`.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where the contact form was not displaying due to a missing `#contact-container` element in `index.html`.
- Resolved a CSS issue where certain elements were hidden due to incorrect `display` properties.
- Fixed JavaScript errors related to `fetch` and DOM manipulation.

### Styling Improvements
- Updated the layout and design of the contact form for better responsiveness and usability.
- Refined the `styles.css` file to ensure consistent styling across all pages.

### General Testing
- Tested all navigation links to ensure they work correctly.
- Verified that the contact form submission process works as intended.
- Checked for console errors and resolved any remaining issues.

- Implementing dark mode functionality.
- Optimizing the website for performance.
- Adding PHP and database integration for dynamic content and form handling.

The project is shaping up well, and I look forward to further enhancing its functionality and design!
