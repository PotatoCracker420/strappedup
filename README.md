## What I Did Today

Today, I worked on forming the website for the project. Here are the key tasks I accomplished:

- Designed the initial layout and structure of the website.
- Implemented basic navigation and responsive design.
- Added placeholder content for testing purposes.
- Set up the development environment for future updates.

Looking forward to refining the design and adding more features in the coming days!
